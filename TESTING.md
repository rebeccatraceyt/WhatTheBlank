## Testing User Stories

#### Player Goals:
1. As a player, I want to choose my own username, to personalize my game-playing experience.
    - On entry of the site, if there is no username stored, the player will be presented with a welcome menu.
    - This menu prompts the user to enter the player name of their chose.
    - This name is then called on game-end to personalize the users gaming experience.
2. As a player, I want to intuitively navigate to game mode, to have an easy gaming experience.
    - When the user has entered their player name, they are directed to the home page, which displays the various categories available.
    - Users are prompted to **Choose A Category**. In doing so, they will then be directed to the category page of their choosing.
3. As a player, I want to have a clear score counter, to keep track of my score as I play.
    - The score counter is displayed in the heads-up-display of the game-play section. 
    - It is incremented by 1 each time the user selects the correct answer.
    - Players can watch their score go up as they progress.
    - The player's final score is then displayed in the game-end, allowing users to view their score and compare it to their high score in that category.
4. As a player, I want to have a clear time counter, to keep track of time elapsed.
    - The time counter is displayed in the heads-up-display of the game-play section.
    - The timer begins on page loads and measures the time elapsed in `seconds` for readability.
    - The player's final time is then displayed in the game-end.
5. As a player, I want to get visual/auditory feedback on answers I choose, to see whether they were correct.
    - As the player selects their chosen answer, one of two things occur:
        - If the answer is correct, the button turns green, visually signifying they are correct, and a sound plays, providing positive auditory feedback.
        - If the answer is incorrect, the selected button turns red and the correct answer turns green, providing visual feedback, with a more negative sound playing to provide the appropriate auditory response. 
6. As a player, I want to have the ability to toggle sound effects on or off, to suit my preference.
    - A mute button appears on all pages, conventionally placed in the `navbar` area of the top right corner.
    - There the user can choose whether they want to mute or un-mute.
    - This preference is then stored in the `sessionStorage`, to create a default setting for all pages.
7. As a player, I want to have to ability to choose the game theme (Day vs. Night Mode), to suit my preference.
    - Similarly to the mute button, the toggle function is placed in the top right corner.
    - With appropriate icons, the user can choose day or night mode.
    - This choice is then stored in the `localStorage` to become the default setting across all pages, and for future visits.
    - As well as this, if the user already has system theme preferences selected on the device they are using, the game will reflect that preference.
8. As a player, I want to view my highest session score.
    - When the player completes all questions, a condition determines the text they will be presented with:
        - If their score is the new high score, they will see the **New High Score** details, showing their score. This is then logged in `sessionStorage`.
        - If their score is less than the high score, they will see the **No High Score** details, showing their score, as well as the current high score.
9. As a player, I want to have the option to replay the game once I have finished to start again.
    - Once they have completed all questions, the player will be presented with the game-end text. 
    - No matter their score, the player will have the option to **play** again (or to **try** again), using an appropriate **redo** icon.
10. As a player, I want to provide suggestions to the developer to upgrade the game, enhancing my user experience.
    - In the footer, the user can access a suggestions form, allowing them to send a message to the developer.
    - Using **EmailJS**, the form is validated and will send a message to both the developer and the sender.
11. As a player, I want to connect with the developer on a social platform of my choosing to see their other projects.
    - In the footer, there are appropriate icons indicating the developers selected social platforms.
    - Conventionally, these links open in a new tab.

## User testing 
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues. Their helpful advice throughout the process led to many UX changes in order to create a better experience. 

It was through this testing that the following changes were made:
- Change to the Navbar background color on mobiles in order for the toggler menu icon to more distinguishable to the background image.
- Change to Navbar font-size on mobile for clearer reading.
- Complete overhaul of Live page in order to display the information in a more user-friendly way.
